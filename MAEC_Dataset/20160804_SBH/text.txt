Thank you.
Well, first of all, I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today.
To sum up for the quarter, our consolidated results were solid, with 3.1% sales growth, gross margin expansion of 30 basis points, and earnings per share growth of 18%.
In addition, we completed several key initiatives in both segments that will position us for long-term success, and we think we can establish very simple agendas going forward that will drive sales growth.
Thank you, and I look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months.
