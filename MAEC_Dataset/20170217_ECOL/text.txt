Yes.
So <UNK>, the challenging part of doing large acquisitions, especially when you're measuring return on capitals, we're not buying these assets for a 2 to 3-year return, so this is a lifetime return for these assets, and we are still confident that we're going to be able to glow that to a double-digit.
I still think that we're probably three to five years out, and it's probably on the tail end of that.
To get those up.
And it's really driving the operating leverage in the business, and putting additional assets to work, and doing, further integrating our systems, and doing all of the items on our strategic roadmap that gets us there.
And it's going to take time, it's going to take commitment.
We're well underway.
This softness since the acquisition hasn't helped that effort, but as we're starting to see, if we truly believe we're at, whether it's a trough or the start of an expansion on the industrial cycle, we think we're poised to start capturing that going forward.
To be honest with you, we don't anticipate much impact from NAFTA.
I think that hearing and reading probably what others are reading, is our trading relationship right now as a nation with Canada is very strong both directions, and I don't think that that's under the radar screen of what the current administration's looking at.
It's more going south, and we don't do a tremendous amount of business down in Mexico.
And so what we're seeing here, we are continuing to monitor it, we don't know ultimately what will happen, no one does.
But where we're sitting today, is we don't see much impact there.
Thank you.
I want to thank all of those that participated in the call today, and we look forward to updating you as we progress through 2017.
Have a wonderful weekend.
Thank you.
