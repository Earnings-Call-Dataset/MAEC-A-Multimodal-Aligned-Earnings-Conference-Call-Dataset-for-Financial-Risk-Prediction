Thank you.
As we've come just beyond our first anniversary in our relationship with Dell, I can tell you that everything is going at or above the plans that we are tracking very well to expectation.
We continue to see a lot of growth opportunity there.
It's not just earning our fair share of business with Dell was is already legacy in the channel, but Dell has been making proactive movements to shift a lot of their business that had gone direct into the channel.
So we've seen movement there, in particular on the PC side of the business, with increased focus on the enterprise side as well.
Both present probably bigger growth opportunities to SYNNEX than it would to some others that had legacy relationships, so we do view that as all upside incremental growth opportunity for us.
With EMC, because we were not an EMC partner prior to the Dell relationship, that has also increased our incremental upside that we see and that really does help us round out some of our overall enterprise offering as well.
We're optimistic on our relationship and growing our business with Dell.
This is <UNK>.
No.
It sticks out in Q1 just because of the way the relation plays to revenue but we're going to overcome it and offset it in full 2016.
Okay.
Thank you very much, Laura, and again, I want to thank all of you for joining our call today.
Happy new year to all of you and we look forward to engaging with you in the coming weeks.
