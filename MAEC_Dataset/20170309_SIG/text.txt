So your first question in terms of the impact of the store closures on sales and profit.
The stores that we're closing and accelerating, we actually -- we will have a benefit towards the existing mall stores when we look at sales transference, and it should only actually help to strengthen our top line and our profit for this year.
And I missed your second part of that question.
Yes, <UNK>.
There's several initiatives that I said in my prepared comments.
Let me just get my notes here a second.
We are investing specifically in digital marketing, and we are investing in enhancing our architecture that we believe will enhance our content, our customer content review.
We are investing in making sure heavily in the Zales platform, we are actually putting Zales because their platform is a platform that does not have a future, so we're investing heavily in a new platform which is a hybrid platform for our Zales brand.
So we've got -- there's a lot more invested, and we could talk about in more detail, <UNK>, off the call.
But we're investing in digital marketing.
We're investing in a huge new platform for Zales, and we're investing in the architecture to get it corrected for our Sterling brands.
Yes, I think I said, you saw it in the release and I mentioned on the call, what I would say is that there's a shift out of Q1 into Q2 of about 300 to 350 basis points as it relates to sales, and the EPS number I gave you would also factor in any movement on the advertising side as well.
Thank you all for taking part in this call.
Our next scheduled call is to report the first quarter of FY18.
It's on May 25.
Thanks again, everybody, and goodbye.
