So the GAAP -- the non-GAAP adjustments we've made were a couple of things.
One was related to amortization expense, and that will continue at the current -- or the rate in fiscal 2016, continuing into fiscal 2017.
There is also some transaction-related cost upfront, but if you look at our third and fourth fiscal quarter, there was about 1 percentage difference between non-GAAP and GAAP and I think you ought to expect that similar percentage difference going forward.
<UNK>, it's a bit of both.
We're really proud of our growth and execution this quarter and for the year that we have had NexPlanar with us, but obviously far from satisfied.
And you can tell we are gaining more confidence in our ability to really grow this business, and you mentioned to the improved range of $80 million to $90 million by fiscal-year 2018.
That's a combination of growth from existing customers ramping -- we mentioned we are currently selling to eight out of the top 10, but also new products -- or new opportunities in the pipeline, and we mentioned a new consumable set win that we're really excited about.
That's with a major memory manufacturer.
And within that existing customer base, as you would imagine, as they get the pad in and get comfortable with its performance and its just lower cost of ownership, they're able to take that to different applications and proliferate it across their different fabs and different applications, and that's what we are seeing.
So it is a bit of both growth with existing customers, but also a really full pipeline of opportunities in different stages of qualification.
