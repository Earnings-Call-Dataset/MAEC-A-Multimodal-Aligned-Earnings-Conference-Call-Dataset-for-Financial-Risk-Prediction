Good morning.
I think, <UNK>, that your assumptions are probably fairly correct in that we've still been in a fairly lower priced sow environment, and with our higher mix of side dishes.
But as we look into next year and we see sow prices potentially starting to move a little bit higher than maybe we were this year, I would expect to see a corresponding change, as well.
That will continue to fluctuate as we see that sow market move up and down.
I think it's important for shareholders to know that as the sow cost goes up, so does our pricing on the shelf, so that helps to increase sales; therefore, at the end of the day whether or not the sows are going up or coming down, the margins are remaining to be the same, and profitability of those transactions are there.
I think we will continue to look at that.
It's a small part of our business.
We pared a lot of the offerings down to what really fits our core, more in the really breakfast sandwich.
Breakfast is our heritage and our equity.
That's really where our focus is.
A lot of those items that we may have a co-packer, we've pared those down, as well.
There won't be a lot of emphasis on that.
Where it makes sense in our core markets that people want the brand, want to use the brand, we'll continue to focus on that.
Thank you.
Thank you everyone for joining us today.
<UNK> and <UNK> will be presenting at UBS Global Conference tomorrow, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer Retail Conference on Tuesday, March 14.
We look forward to meeting with you, if you are going to attend.
Mean time, have a wonderful day, and we look forward to talking to you next on the next conference.
