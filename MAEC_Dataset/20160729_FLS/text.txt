So, basically from the actual expense going out in 2017, we basically -- you should be looking at it in the concept of approximately $160 million for 2016.
Incremental to that will be in 2017 approximately $90 million for a full spend in 2018 of approximately $400 million.
Going forward, currently we are paying about $15 million a quarter in terms of paying down debt.
So about $60 million annually.
And 2017 will be consistent with that on the debt payments.
