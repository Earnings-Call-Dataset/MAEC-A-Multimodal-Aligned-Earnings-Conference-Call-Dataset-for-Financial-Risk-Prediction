I have a couple, if i might.
First I want to try to decipher a little bit of the political.
I think if I have the numbers right, is it correct that you're kind of looking for political of maybe $9 million to $10 million of revenue this year.
Great.
And then in your prepared remarks you mentioned the lease expense being flat in the first quarter.
Can you just elaborate on what was driving that and is it sustainable for the next couple of quarters or at least the rest of the year.
So it does sound like you think it could be closer to flat than plus 1% for just the near term.
Okay.
And then last question for <UNK>.
<UNK>, in the recent past you've talked to us about the lack of inflation in the U.S. economy being a hindrance to your ability to drive rate and price on your boards, and you have moved into a little bit more of a pro-inflation environment.
So I guess, I was wondering if your -- if that's helping you start to extract a little bit more rate recently or even going forward.
