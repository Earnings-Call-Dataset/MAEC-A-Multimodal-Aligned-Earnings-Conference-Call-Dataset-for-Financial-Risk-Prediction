<UNK>, thank you for the question.
In terms of significant major uplift in e-commerce business in the markets that we've rebranded the stores, we're not seeing a dramatic change in the e-commerce business.
In terms of as we're closing stores, we are working to definitely migrate our consumer into our other locations.
We're starting that with Phipps in Atlanta, to really make sure that we're managing customer by customer, and whether that's moving them to another one of our full-line stores, whether it's moving them to our e-commerce business or one of our specialty or department store partners, we're working through that process and we know that will be important.
As we look at closing the 15 stores over the next two years, we're obviously working through that process.
We expect that the majority of that closing will happen more towards the end of this year, going into next year, just to put that in perspective.
Thank you.
We know we still have a lot of work to do, but feel confident we are on the right path and have the financial strength to transform Vera Bradley into a stronger Company.
We will continue to work diligently to improve our performance and enhance shareholder value.
Thank you for joining us today.
We look forward to speaking to you on our first-quarter call on May 31.
