I would tell you that, specifically in the example you gave in terms of paving, we go to market now as one face for the customer benefit.
We report to you obviously through our financials reflective of the fact that one of the business is chemical sourced and the other business is traditional polymer sourced.
But with respect to what's most important in terms of driving growth, the view of the customer is that this is now a newly extended off-product offering to the customer face that comes from both primarily our road marking business, in the case of the Chemical segment, and our traditional bitumen modification in the case of the Polymer business.
And the customers obviously view that as quite a positive development.
We report extremely based on how we allocate capital and the way <UNK> makes decisions, which is in the segments of Polymers and Chemicals.
We have a head of Commercial who runs the commercial organizations and we've set up the commercial organization essentially around end-use markets tucked within each of the reporting segments.
And then we also run a global operational organization that ensures the plants, whether they are in the Chemical or the Polymer segments, are running optimally.
